    <h2>What Our Clients Say</h2>
    <div class="carousel-track" id="carouselTrack">
      <div class="testimonial"><div class="Client A">Annie Estlin, Science Research Manager, NPCC</div>Dan brought deep subject expertise, a strong network of relevant contacts, and a sustained awareness of emerging research and developments in this evolving area. He has a remarkable ability to distil complex topics into clear, actionable focus areas, and to relay this content in an accessible and understandable way for the intended audience. He was very easy to work with being consistently responsive, organised, and dependable. His proactive and pragmatic approach was instrumental in delivering both tangible and valuable work aligned with the project's goals.</div>
      <div class="testimonial"><div class="Client B">Sam Brooks, Head of F&I, ACE</div>'m amazed at the quality of the deliverable and how much you were able to advance the knowledge base within just 20 days.</div>
      <div class="testimonial"><div class="Client C">Graedon Crouch, MOD Futures Lab</div>I had the privilege of working with Dan for several years. Throughout this time, he was a consummate professional. Of particular note were Dan's excellent analytical skills and written outputs. Having been in a position to review analysis and written work from dozens of people and organisations, I always looked forward to reading his work and can honestly say his outputs were tremendous and near peerless. This is no flippant comment - someone that can research, digest and understand a topic, then write clearly, simply and compelling to answer both general and specific questions is rare. Dan is a master of this art.</div>
      <div class="testimonial"><div class="Client D">Andy Etherington, NCA / NCMEC</div>I have had the pleasure of working with Dan on a number of projects which he has led. His research is meticulous and detail orientated, he has the unique ability to inform both operational tactics and strategic policy decision through his work. I use his research regularly to compliment the ways in which we approach online investigations, and am convinced his insights have had a significant impact in fight against online child sexual exploitation. The work he has done is probably the best insight I get into companies and that includes the face to face meeting I have with them. This work is invaluable.</div>
      <div class="testimonial"><div class="Client E">Russell Bagnall, Home Office</div>Dan undertook a difficult and sensitive research project, and delivered truly outstanding results. He completly exceeded our expectations and as a result we looked to increase our funding to access even more of his high quality work. I wouldn't hesitate to work with Dan again.</div>
